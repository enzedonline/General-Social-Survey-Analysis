# General-Social-Survey-Analysis

This paper forms the final assessment for the Duke University Inferential Statistics course.

The objective is to develop a research question using the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset and then conduct exploratory and inferential analysis in response.

This paper asks *“Is there a link between a person’s concern regarding spending on crime and their socio-economic status?”*

The analysis examines responses to the survey question regarding current spending on halting rising crime and looks at the proportion of each socio-economic group that responded with either too much, too little or about right.

Using the Chi-square test of independence to compare observed and expected proportions, it was determined beyond any reasonable doubt that there is indeed a relationship between the two.
